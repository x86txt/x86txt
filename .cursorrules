# Cursor Rules for Code Generation

## Commit Messages

When generating commit messages, use the following format prefixes (not conventional commits):

- **Added:** - for new features (instead of `feat:`)
- **Fixed:** - for bug fixes (instead of `fix:`)
- **Performance:** - for performance improvements (instead of `perf:`)
- **Changed:** - for refactoring (instead of `refactor:`)
- **Documentation:** - for documentation updates (instead of `docs:`)

Examples:
- ✅ "Added user authentication feature"
- ✅ "Fixed memory leak in cache handler"
- ✅ "Performance improved database query speed"
- ✅ "Changed API structure for better maintainability"
- ✅ "Documentation updated README with new features"

Do NOT use: `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`
