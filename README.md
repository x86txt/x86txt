## About me

I'm a Principal Engineer with 25+ years of experience across cloud, infrastructure, automation, and security. I enjoy big-picture architecture just as much as hands-on implementation, and I put a lot of care into building systems that are resilient, observable, and maintainable.

- **Cloud & platforms**: Designing and operating multi-cloud and hybrid environments with a strong focus on reliability and cost-awareness.
- **Automation & DevOps**: Turning tribal knowledge into code—CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and robust release pipelines.
- **Security & governance**: Baking security into platforms and workflows instead of bolting it on at the end.

## What I'm focused on right now

- **AI-augmented engineering**: Integrating LLMs and agentic systems into day-to-day workflows in IP-safe, security-conscious ways.
- **Platform & SRE practices**: Standardizing golden paths, improving observability, and reducing toil for engineering teams.
- **Secure-by-default infrastructure**: Using automation to enforce policy, detect drift, and keep systems hardened at scale.

## 🤖 AI & agentic systems

I'm particularly excited about the rapidly evolving field of AI, LLMs, and agentic systems. I've integrated AI into my workflows to dramatically reduce completion times while respecting security boundaries and IP constraints, using it to architect and build everything from small utilities to complex multi-component solutions.
