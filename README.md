> [!NOTE]
> I'm particularly excited about the rapidly evolving field of AI, LLMs, and agentic systems. As this technology continues to develop, I've integrated AI solutions into my workflows in IP-safe ways that enhance productivity while respecting security boundaries. I've used these technologies to architect and develop both simple utilities and complex, multi-component solutions. This intersection of AI with traditional infrastructure represents a fascinating frontier with tremendous potential for innovation in automation, analysis, and decision support.
